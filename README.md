# Machine learning one-dimensional spinless trapped fermionic systems with neural-network quantum states

This repo is a generalization for the D-dimensional case of the NQS found in https://github.com/jwtkeeble/SpinlessFermions. In ordert to simulate any model it is needed to run first the file run.py, then generate_many_body_data.py and at last, plot_figures.py.
